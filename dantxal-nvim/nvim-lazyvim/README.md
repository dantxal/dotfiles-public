It also includes some resources from linkarzu, which could be seen in the neovim folder on the root of this repo.

# Things to remember

## See messages history

Use the command `NoiceHistory`

## Spectre pattern matching

- I needed to match:
  - `>/dev/null 2>&1`
- So I used (but didn't work, and don't have time to deal with this right now)
  - `[>]\/dev\/null 2[>]\&1`
